# Project Title

Smoothie App "Froots"

## Description

Our goal is to create a smoothie recipe app that is fun, fresh, and accessible to users of all ages.
The app allows users to browse a collection of smoothie recipes complete with nutritional information, and also create and save their own recipes. The purpose of our app is to help smoothie enthusiasts keep track of their favourite blends, support their health goals, and discover new flavour combinations with ease.
We identified a niche for a recipe app thatâ€™s both playful in design and practical for smoothies. By combining clear visuals, nutritional insights, and personal recipe creation, Froots fills the gap between casual browsing and health-conscious nutrient tracking.

The user story is divided into two sections, **Level 1 - Basic** is the standard we're aiming for in this project. **Level 2 - Advanced** has partially been fulfilled in the project, but were planned as additional features to impliment considering time constraints and the real project timeline.

**Level 1 - Basic _(Completed)_**

As the (small screen) user, I want to click the recipe name button within a recipe card and open the expanded recipe page.
In the recipe page, I can see the recipe ingredients, nutritional information, and read/add/modify notes.
As the (large screen) user, I can browse the full recipes on the screen.
As the user I can use the search bar to find a recipe of my choosing from the listing.

**Level 2 - Advanced _(Partially Completed)_**

As the user, I can click the New Smoothie button, and create a smoothie in that page (with custom title, preparation time, ingredients, and notes, and save it to my recipes.
In addition, I can also see my recipe ingredients dynamically update nutritional information while creating a new smoothie.
As the user, I may also edit and save the notes within ready recipes.
In addition to above, as the user, I can upload a custom picture when creating a new recipe.
As the user, I am able to favourite recipes, and view my favourites.
As the user, I am able to view separate tabs (for example; browse recipes, my recipes, favourites, and create recipe)
As the user, I am able to delete recipes, and edit premade recipes.

### Executing program

- To start using the app simply run following command:

```

```

- Vite should open a port which will enable you to run the app inside browser.
- If it doesn't open a browser window automatically, open your preferred browser and go to http://localhost:5173/

- Alternatively, you can also use our deployed version here (no installation required):

## Help

All new created smoothies are stored inside LocalStorage, so if you decide to delete your recipes you have to clear cache and cookies from your browser. This will make it so the application starts like first time - with only template recipes showing.
