## Goals

How did we achieve those goals?


## User Story
Level 1 - Basic  
- As the (small screen) user, I want to click the recipe name button within a recipe card and open the expanded recipe page. 
- In the recipe page, I can see the recipe ingredients, nutritional information, and additional notes. 
- As the (large screen) user, I can browse the full recipes on the screen, and scroll down on each recipe card. 
- As the user I can use the search bar to find a recipe of my choosing from the listing.

Level 2 - Advanced  
- In addition to above, as the user, I want to click the add button and open a recipe creation page. In this page, I can upload a picture, fill in the title, ingredients, and additional notes fields, and save it to my recipes. 
- As the user, I may also edit and save the notes within ready recipes. 
- As the user, I am able to view separate tabs: browse recipes, my recipes, and create recipe.
